Instructions for running ttf_to_adafruit_gfx.sh:

Dependencies:
  fonttools
    fonttools must be installed
    pyftsubset is part of fonttools, a python based command line tool for 
    manipulating fonts. pyftsubset will be used to generate 2 subsets of the 
    desired font.
  Adafruit fontconvert
    Adafruit provides a tool as part of their Adafruit GFX Library that converts
    font files to c-style arrays that can be used by the before-mentioned 
    library. The necessary components have been included as part of this 
    repository.
    https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library/tree/master/fontconvert
  freetype2
    dependency for fontconvert.

To run this script execute the following command:
  ./ttf_to_adafruit_gfx.sh /path/to/font.otf

What does this script do?
  This script converts ttf or otf (font) files to c-style arrays to be used by 
  the Adafruit GFX Library.

  2 font subsets will be generated:
    1. ASCII
    2. Numbers (0-9), decimal point (.) and the degree symbol (°)

  This is done to conserve EEPROM space. 
  (only need 0-9/./° for the large primary temperature display)

The fonts used for this project could be swapped out relatively easily if desired.
