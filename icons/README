HOW TO RUN SCRIPT TO GENERATE .h FILES FROM .svg FILES
---
svg_to_headers.sh, will convert the svg files in ./svg/ to the
specified size of .png which will then be converted to header files each 
containing a bitmap, formatted into a c-style array for use by the AdafruitGFX 
library. This script depends on png_to_header.py (in this folder).

Usage:
  bash svg_to_headers.sh <size_of_output_image>

Dependencies: 
  Inkscape - Inkscape's cli is used to convert .svg to .png
  Python3

To regenerate all icons execute the following command:
bash svg_to_headers.sh 16 & bash svg_to_headers.sh 24 & bash svg_to_headers.sh 32 & bash svg_to_headers.sh 48 & bash svg_to_headers.sh 64 & bash svg_to_headers.sh 96 & bash svg_to_headers.sh 128 & bash svg_to_headers.sh 160 & bash svg_to_headers.sh 196
