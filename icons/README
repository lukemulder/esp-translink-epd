Weather icons (.svg files) were obtained from:
https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/

The bash script, svg_to_headers.sh, will convert the svg files to various 
sizes of png which will then be converted to header files each containing 
a bitmap formatted for use by the G6EJP EPD library.

bash svg_to_headers.sh <large_png_density> <small_png_density>
